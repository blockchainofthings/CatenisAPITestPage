# Catenis API Test Page

This is an HTML page that can be used to exercise and test every aspect of the Catenis Enterprise REST API.

This current release is compliant with version 0.8 of the Catenis API.

## Preparations

This page requires version 4.0.0 of the Catenis API Javascript client library.

Download the library from its [repository](https://github.com/blockchainofthings/CatenisAPIClientJS/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
 and place its files (*CatenisAPIClientJS.min.js* and optionally *CatenisAPIClientJS.min.map*) in a subdirectory named
 `lib`. 

## Usage

Open the *TestCatenisAPI.html* page in a web browser, select the appropriate Catenis API environment and enter the ID
 and the API access secret of the Catenis virtual device to use.
 
To call the Catenis API methods, click on the appropriate category (*Messages*, *Assets* or *Permission & Notification*)
 then fill up and submit the corresponding form.
